{Wed: PyTe}
===========

For school, as seniors we have a capstone project to complete, as a result of wanting to learn more and do more work with web services and web apps, I decided to convert PyTe to a web service and App with both mobile and desktop versions.

Enter {Web: PyTe}
----------------

{Wed: PyTe} is an attempt at bringing the power and awesomeness of PyTe to the modern browser. Most days I'm running around and may not always have my netbook on me, however I always have either my phone with a 3G connection, or another computer that I can use at my disposal. As a result, I also don't always have the option to use PyTe when I most want him.
